Warrior_Simulation
==================

A simulation of a duel among warriors with modular design so including other factors is simple

To-Do List:

-Filiprei:
--Armour class

-FredBill:
--Weapon class

-Daleth:
--Warrior ( Pending Review )

-Gilbit:
--Environment class

-(?)
--Event/Interaction Manager
--Interface

We might want to set some reachable, reasonable goals so our codes don't shoot for the moon and never come back.
I think the code is reasonable, our goal should be to complete our individual classes then we just need to connect 
them together with the warrior class. (Yep it will be a big job for the person doing warrior class) When we get closer
to finish I'll work on the user interface.
