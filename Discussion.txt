Oh, hey look, a IDC (In Delay-time Chat)! >_>

Now what

Well I am currently working on reworking the environment header then making the source file for the classes.
I am going to make it into 3 classes instead of like 15. What all environmental factors do you guys think I
should factor in? So far I am thinking Ecosystem( where the ba)ttle takes place ), Weather( what the weather 
is like ) and the time of day( night/day ). Certain "Warriors" will benefit better in special scenarios than
others for example a modern soldier would do much better at night than a medieval soldier since we have night-
vision and someone who is from a certian area will know the landscape and will do slightly better while fighting
there compared to someone who is not naturally from that area ex a knight fighting in a desert vs someone that is
from the desert like a bandit or something.

-There is currently nothing about your ecosystem class that resembles the logic of an ecosystem, FYI:

-Modern soldiers do not have tactical advantage over a medieval soldier if they are without those precious goggles. 
Therefore, that should not be an innate characteristic.
-Night/Day sounds like a good idea. You can google types of weather and landscapes to get other types of environment
factors.
-How exactly are your three classes going to interact? I would have derived at least Weather and Landscape from
environment.
-Somebody help me figure out what's missing from my Warrior class?

Oh yes I meant landscape not ecosystem not sure what I was thinking. They were interacting as derived classes origonally
but I was trying to make the variables protected and it would not work when I was trying to initialize them on the other
environment class but I suppose I could of just made them public variables instead on the landscape/weather environment.
Also I think it will be best if we have a weapon class before a environment class so I think I will start working on
that since it seems to be only me , you , and possibly filiprei.

Are you going to include like a warband/group of soliders to your class? For example a group of bandits could have
a sniper , a demolionist , a medic , and foot soldier. Oh and I think possibly adding a medic to the list where you have
strongmen / sharpeye. The medic won't "Heal" them but could stop bleeding, set bones ( if they are broken from a
hand-hand fight, tripping, getting hit by vehicle or something else ), supply crutches. Just suggestions on what a medic
could possibly do. Also, with your accuracy is that how accurate they are to hit a target or like a specific limb?
Someone could hit a guy 90% of the time but would not necessarly mean they are all head or body shots they could be
like arm/leg shots. Depending on the area where they are hit I would assume the person gets hurt more or incapitated more.
Back to the group of soldiers...I think different groups might have different leadership skills/tactics for the battle.
Some groups just do their own thing like barbarians I believe. Other groups though are more organized which could lead
to a slight advantage in the battle.

-Ah, okay I see, so you meant landscape. And what do you mean you had trouble initializing the protected variables?
-Wait a little longer on the weapon class. If we can get FredBill to make an account, we'll save a lot of work by adding his
file to the project.
-My enum class for Strongman and Sharpeye are really more descriptions for the attribute values, not the particular skill
of the warrior. Something like a demolitionist or a medic would describe more the equipment the warrior would have, and
my W_Template enum would be part of what describes that specialty. For example, a sniper could be described as having
a sniper rilfe, scope, goggles, camoflague, ammunition pack, and the attributes of the Sharpeye W_Template. But I think
can create another enum for the warrior specialties. Sounds like a good idea for a factory method, which I still need
to practice.
-As for the whole band thing, that can be a different class with its own building methods, because my class is for
individual warriors. I might try to incorporate the party/band/team thing after I'm done defining the warrior class.
-leadership sounds like an innate characteristic I can add as a private variable
-The accuracy of the warrior is defined to be a general case: for every attempt the warrior makes, what is his/her chance
of successfully hitting the target
-Separating the amount of endurance for each body part sounds like a good idea; definitely the kind of thing that 
should be implemented. I'll get on that right now.
