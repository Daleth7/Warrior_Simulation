Oh, hey look, a IDC (In Delay-time Chat)! >_>

Now what

Well I am currently working on reworking the environment header then making the source file for the classes.
I am going to make it into 3 classes instead of like 15. What all environmental factors do you guys think I
should factor in? So far I am thinking Ecosystem( where the ba)ttle takes place ), Weather( what the weather 
is like ) and the time of day( night/day ). Certain "Warriors" will benefit better in special scenarios than
others for example a modern soldier would do much better at night than a medieval soldier since we have night-
vision and someone who is from a certian area will know the landscape and will do slightly better while fighting
there compared to someone who is not naturally from that area ex a knight fighting in a desert vs someone that is
from the desert like a bandit or something.

-There is currently nothing about your ecosystem class that resembles the logic of an ecosystem, FYI:

-Modern soldiers do not have tactical advantage over a medieval soldier if they are without those precious goggles. 
Therefore, that should not be an innate characteristic.
-Night/Day sounds like a good idea. You can google types of weather and landscapes to get other types of environment
factors.
-How exactly are your three classes going to interact? I would have derived at least Weather and Landscape from
environment.
-Somebody help me figure out what's missing from my Warrior class?
